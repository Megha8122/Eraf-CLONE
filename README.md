# Eraf Clone Project with ScrollTrigger and GSAP

Welcome to the Eraf Clone Project! In this project, we'll be replicating elements of the Eraf website using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) along with ScrollTrigger to create engaging scroll-based animations and interactions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to recreate specific elements or sections of the Eraf website and enhance them with captivating animations triggered by scrolling. We'll focus on implementing scroll-triggered effects to bring the content to life and provide an immersive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the webpage content.
  
- **CSS**: Applied for styling elements and defining layout.
  
- **GSAP**: Utilized for creating sophisticated animations and interactions.
  
- **ScrollTrigger**: Integrated with GSAP to trigger animations based on scroll events.

## Key Features

- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Implement animations that activate as the user scrolls through the webpage.
  
- **Section Replication**: Replicate specific sections of the Eraf website while adding creative animations to enhance visual appeal.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the webpage is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- Setting up GSAP animations and timelines.
  
- Implementing ScrollTrigger to control animations based on scroll position.
  
- Creating complex scroll-based effects to elevate user engagement.
